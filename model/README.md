# XAS_featurization
Robust machine learning inference from X-ray absorption near edge spectra through featurization

This folder includes trained machine learning models from this work. The models are named in the format `comp/exp_faeture_algo_model.pkl`.  For example, `comp_cdf_rfc_model.pkl` refers to the random forest classifier model trained on cumulative distribution function (CDF) feature that was generated based on computed XAS data.
