# XAS_featurization
Robust machine learning inference from X-ray absorption near edge spectra through featurization

This folder contains inputs from various codes to generate spectroscopy and to perform structural relaxation. The naming of subfolders follows `CODE+calculation_type` format. For example, "FEFF_spec" refers to the inputs for FEFF to generate XAS spectroscopy.
